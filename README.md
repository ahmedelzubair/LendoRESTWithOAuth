# Getting Started

### Reference Documentation

How to use the API:

- Please clone this repository and run it locally. 

- find the API postman collection in the root folder of the project.
Import it.
- You can use the saved user in postman collection or open AppSecurityConfig.java to set your user in the inMemoryAuthentication method.
- Then you can get the access token and refresh token from the response headers of the login process.
- After that you are good to go with testing all protected routes.

By default, the authorization header is set to Bearer token in the header of the parent folder of the postman collection, so you need to change it with your own.

Hope this what you are looking for.

Thanks and I am looking forward to hearing from you.
